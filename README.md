Time Complexity Checker
This project is a Time Complexity Analyzer that allows users to paste any Python code and estimates its time complexity based on the execution time for various input sizes. It provides a graphical representation of how the code's execution time scales with increasing input sizes.

Features
Dynamic Code Execution: Users can input any Python function, and the system dynamically runs the code to measure its execution time.
Time Complexity Estimation: Based on execution times, the system estimates the best-fit time complexity (e.g., O(n), O(n^2), etc.).
Execution Time Plotting: The project generates a graph that plots the execution time against different input sizes to visually show how the algorithm scales.
Timeout Handling: To prevent long-running or infinite loops, a timeout feature is implemented for execution.
Interactive GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface is created using Tkinter, allowing easy interaction for code input and analysis.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used to develop the project.
Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) to input code and display results.
Matplotlib: Used for plotting the execution times against input sizes to visualize the time complexity.
NumPy: A library used for efficient mathematical operations (e.g., logarithmic calculations).
Signal: Used for handling timeouts in case the userâ€™s code takes too long to execute.
cProfile (Optional): For profiling the code if deeper analysis of function performance is required.
How It Works
Code Input: The user pastes their Python function inside a text box in the GUI. The function must be named user_function(n) where n is an input size.
Execution Time Measurement: The code is dynamically executed for different input sizes, and the execution time is measured.
Time Complexity Estimation: The execution times are compared with theoretical complexities (e.g., O(n), O(n^2), etc.) to estimate the best-fit complexity.
Results Display: The results are displayed in a message box, showing the estimated time complexity and the execution times for each input size.
Graphical Plot: A plot is generated that shows the relationship between input size and execution time.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-complexity-checker.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include:
Copy
Edit
matplotlib
numpy
tkinter
Usage
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python time_complexity_checker.py
The application window will open, allowing you to paste your Python code.
Press the "Analyze Time Complexity" button to see the results.
The application will display the estimated time complexity, execution times, and a plot graph.
Example Code
Paste any Python code in the input box, such as:

python
Copy
Edit
def user_function(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total
The system will measure how the execution time scales with increasing input sizes.
